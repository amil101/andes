 * Interface used to abstract common attributes and behaviour of similar enums.

 * virtual-host related) But all config properties have the same attributes.
 * the key, default value, and data type. By implementing this interface hierarchy,
 * we can avoid code duplication of repeating these properties and their access logic.
